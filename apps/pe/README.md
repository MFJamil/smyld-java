# SMYLD Portal Engine

## What is it?

Portal Engine is a java based framework that facilitates the work with GUI interfaces via establishing a compelete segregation between GUI layer and other modules of the software, the target is to eleminate the boilerplate code and to alleviates dealing with GUI components.

## History 

The framework was originally designed to deal with Swing Components back in 2004, and it was successfully used in many applications that had saved a considerable time. Unfortunately, it was not shared as an Open Source project at that time. Later on it was developed to coup with new technologies, like using Annotations instead of interfaces to interact with the business layer, being available on Maven Central Repository, re-structured to be easily used by other developers in a similar way as the case with Spring boot ..etc. 

### Swing! are you serious? in 2019!
Well you are right, many alternatives are available but do not forget some facts:

#### 1 - Multi-threading 
#### 2 - Performance
#### 3 - Intellij

**Intellij !** ... YES! one of the most powerful editors in the market is still written with Swing. However Jet Brains holds also a powerful development team. Still, it is written in Swing.

**What about Java FX!** Well, till now, the performance is still on the side of Swing.


**However this is not only about Swing!**
