# SMYLD Portal Engine
Portal Engine is establishing a compelete segregation between GUI layer and other modules of the software, the target is to eleminate the boilerplate code and to alleviates dealing with GUI components. The framework was originally designed to deal with Swing Components back in 2004, was successfully used with many applications which saved considerable time.

### Swing! are you serious? in 2019!
Well you are right, many alternatives are available but do not forget two facts:

#### 1 - Multi-threading 
#### 2 - Performance
#### 3 - Intellij

**Intellij !** ... YES! one of the most powerful editors in the market is still written with Swing. However Jet Brains holds also a powerful development team. Still, it is written in Swing.

**What about Java FX!** Well, till now, the performance is still on the side of Swing.


**However this is not only about Swing!** 



## Portal Engine Concept
The Portal Engine concept is to deal with the GUI layer as a separate module that will interact with the rest of the modules via defined interfaces. The GUI definition can take different forms:
#### 1 - XML file
#### 2 - YAML file
#### 3 - JSON file
#### 4 - Data Base

The Portal Engin will handle reading the file and generating the required components. The Components can belong to any technology/framework. We can define the components to two types:

#### 1 - Desktop:
Desktop based widgets can be any of the following:
##### 1 - JDK/Swing
##### 2 - JDK/SWT
##### 3 - Node.js/Electron
##### 4 - Node.js/NW.js
And many more..

#### 2 - Web.
Web based frameworks are available and involve some complexity that can be eliminated by the Portal Engine as well, some of the well known can be:
##### 1 - Angular
##### 2 - React
##### 3 - Vue
And many more ..
